# About
Check memory stats of RAM and SWAP, and if any one of them exceeds the given limit, then notify the user about which process consuming lot of memory or perform swapoff by own but only in that case if user doesn't respond or ignore the emergency notification

the main motive behind this project is to notify the user because the system freezes or hang. So that user can close such applications which take heavy consumption of RAM or CPU.

Just a random project to test some things.

Have fun, Cheers
